Youre on your way home from work and your Fitbit alert goes off: "Congratulations! you've hit your daily steps!" For a moment you marvel about how you managed to get to a number as high as 15 000, just by taking one step at a time.

But what if all that hard work had translated to a different goal - what if your fitbit hadn't reset to zero each night, after setting it up on day 01?

And what if you had just started walking, without turning back... **_Where could you have made it to?_**

## The Goal

Data and technology can put a lot in perspective. We wanted to exploit the natural craving for personalized data visualization to better tell a story, through contrast, about the extent Ugandan children have to walk to get an education.

# To do
- [x] Get domain working completely (Callbacks from Fitbit API can be finnicky)
- [x] Display path of comparision map to front-end (Data is already present in backend)
- [x] Transfer domain from domain.com to Google Domains
- [x] Fix user location bug. Currently uses starting point as Heroku servers in the US
- [ ] Enable buttons to be active
- [ ] Fix POST request for sending data to backend
- [ ] Quantify time to find longest city (Out of X cities, takes Y seconds to find farthest city using our algorithm)
- [ ] Subscription service for donations: Tracks if the user walked 12km that day, charges $X per Ykm missed from goal and donates to charity selected
- [ ] Expose data via a RESTful API
